# Purpose of AccrediFy

## The Challenge of Laboratory Compliance

Maintaining compliance in a laboratory setting is a complex, high-stakes responsibility. For Primary Health Centre (PHC) labs and similar facilities, this involves adhering to stringent licensing requirements, MSDS standards, and quality control protocols.

Traditionally, this process is fraught with challenges:

- **Information Overload**: Standards documents are often lengthy, dense, and difficult to translate into actionable tasks.
- **Manual Labor**: Compliance managers spend countless hours manually creating checklists, writing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and tracking recurring tasks.
- **Fragmented Systems**: Evidence—such as calibration certificates, training logs, and safety drill records—is often scattered across shared drives, email inboxes, and physical binders.
- **Audit Stress**: Preparing for an audit becomes a frantic, time-consuming scramble to gather documents and prove compliance.
- **Risk of Human Error**: Manual data entry and tracking can lead to missed deadlines, incomplete logs, and overlooked requirements, putting the lab's license at risk.

## Our Vision: The Single Source of Truth

The vision for AccrediFy is to create a **single source of truth** for all laboratory compliance activities. It aims to be an intelligent, proactive partner for lab directors and quality managers, not just a passive checklist tool.

Our goal is to empower labs to move from a reactive to a proactive compliance culture, where audits are a simple matter of record and not a source of stress.
